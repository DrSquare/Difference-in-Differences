\section{Differential timing}

\subsection{Bacon decomposition}

\begin{frame}{Differential timing}

\begin{itemize}
\item We covered mostly the simple two group case
\item In the two group case, we can estimate the ATT under parallel trends using OLS with unit and time fixed effects
\item If we have covariates, then we can use TWFE under restrictive assumptions, or we have other options (OR, IPW, DR)
\item Now let's move to a more common scenario where we have more than two groups who get treated at various times
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{2x2 versus differential timing}

\begin{itemize}
	\item For this next part, similar to how we did with Sant'Anna and Zhao (2020), we will decompose TWFE to understand what it needs for unbiasedness under differential timing
	\item All of this is from Goodman-Bacon (2021, forthcoming) though the expression of the weights is from 2018 for personal preference
	\item Goodman-Bacon (2021, forthcoming) shows that parallel trends is \textbf{not enough} for TWFE to be unbiased when treatment adoption is described by differential timing
	\item TWFE with differential timing uses treated groups as controls -- not all estimators do -- and this can introduce bias
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Decomposition Preview}

\begin{itemize}
\item TWFE estimates a parameter that is a weighted average over all 2x2 in your sample
\item TWFE assigns weights that are a function of sample sizes of each ``group'' and the variance of the treatment dummies for those groups
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Decomposition (cont.)}

\begin{itemize}
\item TWFE needs two assumptions: that the variance weighted parallel trends are zero (far more parallel trends iow) and no dynamic treatment effects (not the case with 2x2)
\item Under those assumptions, TWFE estimator estimates the variance weighted ATT as a weighted average of all possible ATTs
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{$K^2$ distinct DDs}

Let's look at 3 timing groups (a, b and c) and one untreated group (U).  With 3 timing groups, there are 9 2x2 DDs.  Here they are:


\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c}
\multicolumn{1}{l}{} &
\multicolumn{1}{l}{} &
\multicolumn{1}{l}{} \\
\midrule
a to b & b to a & c to a \\
a to c & b to c & c to b \\
a to U & b to U & c to U \\
\midrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\bigskip

Let's return to a simpler example with only two groups -- a $k$ group treated at $t_k^*$ and an $l$ treated at $t_l^*$ plus an never-treated group called the $U$ untreated group
\end{frame} 


\begin{frame}{Terms and notation}

\begin{itemize}
\item Let there be two treatment groups (k,l) and one untreated group (U)
\item k,l define the groups based on when they receive treatment (differently in time) with k receiving it earlier than l
\item Denote $\overline{D}_k$ as the share of time each group spends in treatment status
\item Denote $\widehat{\delta}_{jb}^{2x2}$ as the canonical $2\times 2$ DD estimator for groups $j$ and b where $j$ is the treatment group and $b$ is the comparison group
\end{itemize}

TWFE estimate yields a weighted combination of each groups' respective 2x2 (of which there are 4 in this example)
\begin{eqnarray*}	
\widehat{\delta}^{DD} = \sum_{k \neq U} s_{kU}\widehat{\delta}_{kU}^{2x2} + \sum_{k \neq U} \sum_{l>k} s_{kl}  \bigg [ \mu_{kl}\widehat{\delta}_{kl}^{2x2,k} + (1-\mu_{kl}) \widehat{\delta}_{lk}^{2x2,l} \bigg]
\end{eqnarray*}where that first 2x2 combines the k compared to U and the l to U (combined to make the equation shorter)

\end{frame}
	


\begin{frame}{Third, the Weights}

 \begin{eqnarray*} s_{ku} &=& \frac{ n_k n_u \overline{D}_k (1- \overline{D}_k ) }{ \widehat{Var} ( \tilde{D}_{it} )} \\
s_{kl} &=& \frac{ n_k n_l (\overline{D}_k - \overline{D}_{l} ) ( 1- ( \overline{D}_k - \overline{D}_{l} )) }{\widehat{Var}(\tilde{D}_{it})} \\
\mu_{kl} &=& \frac{1 - \overline{D}_k }{1 - ( \overline{D}_k - \overline{D}_{l} )}
\end{eqnarray*}where $n$ refer to sample sizes, $\overline{D}_k (1- \overline{D}_k )$ $(\overline{D}_k - \overline{D}_{l} ) ( 1- ( \overline{D}_k - \overline{D}_{l} ))$ expressions refer to variance of treatment, and the final equation is the same for two timing groups.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Weights discussion}

\begin{itemize}
\item Two things to note:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item More units in a group, the bigger its 2x2 weight is
	\item Group treatment variance weights up or down a group's 2x2
	\end{itemize}
\item Think about what causes the treatment variance to be as big as possible. Let's think about the $s_{ku}$ weights.
	\begin{itemize}
	\item $\overline{D}=0.1$. Then $0.1 \times 0.9 = 0.09$
	\item $\overline{D}=0.4$. Then $0.4 \times 0.6 =0.24$
	\item $\overline{D}=0.5$. Then $0.5 \times 0.5 = 0.25$
	\item $\overline{D}=0.6$. Then $0.6 \times 0.4 = 0.24$
	\end{itemize}
\item This means the weight on treatment variance is maximized for \emph{groups treated in middle of the panel}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{More weights discussion}

\begin{itemize}
\item But what about the ``treated on treated'' weights (i.e., $\overline{D}_k - \overline{D}_{l} $)  
\item Same principle as before - when the difference between treatment variance is close to 0.5, those 2x2s are given the greatest weight
\item For instance, say $t^*_k=0.15$ and $t^*_l=0.67$. Then $\overline{D}_k - \overline{D}_{l} = 0.52$.  And thus $0.52 \times 0.48 = 0.2496$.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Summarizing TWFE centralities}

\begin{itemize}
\item Groups in the middle of the panel weight up their respective 2x2s via the variance weighting
\item Decomposition highlights the strange role of panel length when using TWFE
\item Different choices about panel length change both the 2x2 and the weights based on variance of treatment
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

%\begin{frame}[plain]
%\begin{center}
%\textbf{DD Decomposition Theorem}
%\end{center}

%Assume that there are $k=1,\dots,K$ groups of treated units ordered by treatment time $_k^*$ and one control group $U$ which does not receive treatment in the data.  The share of units in group $k$ is $n_k$ and the share of periods that group $k$ spends under treatment is $\overline{D}_k$. The DD estimate from a two-way fixed effects model is a weighted average of all two-group DD estimators.

%\begin{eqnarray*}
%\widehat{\delta}^{DD} = \sum_{k \neq u} s_{ku} \widehat{\delta}_{ku}^{DD} + \sum_{k \neq u} \sum_{l > k} s_{kl} \bigg [ \mu_{kl} \widehat{\delta}_{kl}^{DD,k} + (1-\mu_{kl} ) \widehat{\delta}_{kl}^{DD,l} \bigg ]
%\end{eqnarray*}with weights equal to  \begin{eqnarray*} s_{ku} &=& \frac{ n_k n_u \overline{D}_k (1- \overline{D}_k ) }{ \widehat{Var} ( \tilde{D}_{it} )} \\
%s_{kl'} &=& \frac{ n_k n_l (\overline{D}_k - \overline{D}_{l} ) ( 1- ( \overline{D}_k - \overline{D}_{l} )) }{\widehat{Var}(\tilde{D}_{it})} \\
%\mu_{kl} &=& \frac{1 - \overline{D}_k }{1 - ( \overline{D}_k - \overline{D}_{j'} )}
%\end{eqnarray*}

%\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Moving from 2x2s to causal effects and bias terms}

Let's start breaking down these estimators into their corresponding estimation objects expressed in causal effects and biases


\begin{eqnarray*}
\widehat{\delta}^{2x2}_{kU} &=& ATT_k{Post} + \Delta Y^0_k(Post(k),Pre(k)) - \Delta Y^0_U(Post(k),Pre) \\
\widehat{\delta}^{2x2}_{kl} &=& ATT_k(MID) + \Delta Y^0_k(MID,Pre) - \Delta Y^0_l(MID, Pre)
\end{eqnarray*}These look the same because you're always comparing the treated unit with an untreated unit (though in the second case it's just that they haven't been treated \emph{yet}). 

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{The dangerous 2x2}

But what about the 2x2 that compared the late groups to the already-treated earlier groups? With a lot of substitutions we get:

\begin{eqnarray*}
\widehat{\delta}^{2x2}_{lk} &=& ATT_{l,Post(l)} + \underbrace{\Delta Y^0_l(Post(l),MID) - \Delta Y^0_k ( Post(l), MID)}_{\mathclap{\text{Parallel trends bias}}} \\
&& - \underbrace{(ATT_k(Post) - ATT_k(Mid))}_{\mathclap{\text{Heterogeneity bias!}}}
\end{eqnarray*}


\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Substitute all this stuff into the decomposition formula}

\begin{eqnarray*}	
\widehat{\delta}^{DD} = \sum_{k \neq U} s_{kU}\widehat{\delta}_{kU}^{2x2} + \sum_{k \neq U} \sum_{l>k} s_{kl}  \bigg [ \mu_{kl}\widehat{\delta}_{kl}^{2x2,k} + (1-\mu_{kl}) \widehat{\delta}_{kl}^{2x2,l} \bigg]
\end{eqnarray*}where we will make these substitutions\begin{eqnarray*}
\widehat{\delta}_{kU}^{2x2} &=& ATT_k(Post) + \Delta Y_l^0(Post,Pre) - \Delta Y_U^0(Post, Pre) \\
\widehat{\delta}_{kl}^{2x2,k} &=& ATT_k(Mid) + \Delta Y_l^0(Mid,Pre) - \Delta Y_l^0(Mid, Pre) \\
\widehat{\delta}^{2x2,l}_{lk} &=& ATT_{l}Post(l) + \Delta Y^0_l(Post(l),MID) - \Delta Y^0_k ( Post(l), MID) \\
&&- (ATT_k(Post) - ATT_k(Mid))
\end{eqnarray*}Notice all those potential sources of biases! 

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Potential Outcome Notation}

\begin{eqnarray*}
p\text{ }lim\text{ } \widehat{\delta}^{TWFE}_{n\to\infty} &=& VWATT + VWPT - \Delta ATT
\end{eqnarray*}

\begin{itemize}
\item Notice the number of assumptions needed \emph{even} to estimate this very strange weighted ATT (which is a function of how you drew the panel in the first place). 
\item With dynamics, it attenuates the estimate (bias) and can even reverse sign depending on the magnitudes of what is otherwise effects in the sign in a reinforcing direction! 
\item Model can flip signs (does not satisfy a ``no sign flip property'')
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}



\subsection{Simulation}

\begin{frame}{Simulated data}

\begin{itemize}
\item 1000 firms, 40 states, 25 firms per states, 1980 to 2009 or 30 years, 30,000 observations, four groups
\item $E[Y^0]$ satisfies ``strong parallel trends''  (stronger than necessary)

$$Y^0_{ist} = \alpha_i + \gamma_t + \varepsilon_{ist}$$

\item Also no anticipation of treatment effects until treatment occurs but does \emph{not} guarantee homogenous treatment effects

While large weight on the ``late to early 2x2'' is \emph{suggestive} of an issue, these would appear even if we had constant treatment effects

\begin{itemize}

\item Cheng and Hoekstra (2013) is a good, clean example of a differential timing for us to practice on
\item In 2005, Florida passed a law called Stand Your Ground that expanded self-defense protections beyond the house
\item More ``castle doctrine'' reforms followed from 2006 to 2009

\begin{frame}{Description}

		\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Ambiguous predictions}
	
Castle reforms $\rightarrow$ homicides: Increase by removing homicide penalties and increasing opportunities

	\item $CDL$ is a fraction between 0 and 1 depending on the percent of the year the state has a castle doctrine law 
	\item Preferred specifications includes ``region-by-year fixed effects'' (see next slide)
	\item Estimation with TWFE and Poisson with and without population weights
	\item Models will include covariates (e.g., police, imprisonment, race shares, state spending on public assistance)
	\end{itemize}

	\begin{itemize}

\section{Implicit imputation}

\subsection{CS}

\begin{frame}{Causal inference is imputation}

\begin{quote}
``At some level, all methods for causal inference can be viewed as imputation methods, although some more explicitly than others.'' -- Imbens and Rubin (2015)
\end{quote}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Causal inference involves imputation}

\begin{itemize}
\item Causal inference is a missing data problem -- we are missing counterfactuals
\item And recall that estimating the ATT necessarily involved correctly imputing the counterfactual using parallel trends
\item OLS, therefore, is \emph{implicitly} imputing counterfactuals for estimating the ATT
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Callaway and Sant'Anna 2020}

CS is a DiD model used for estimating ATT parameters under differential timing and conditional parallel trends


\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[scale=0.25]{./lecture_includes/pedro_cites}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{When is CS used}

Just some examples of when you'd want to consider it:
\begin{enumerate}
\item When treatment effects differ depending on when it was adopted
\item When treatment effects change over time
\item When shortrun treatment effects more pronounced than longrun effects
\item When treatment effect dynamics differ if people are first treated in a recession relative to expansion years
\end{enumerate}

\bigskip

In other words -- CS is used to identity and aggregate heterogenous treatment effects

\end{frame}

\end{eqnarray*}CS identifies all feasible ATT(g,t)
         \end{columns} 
    \end{frame}




\begin{frame}{Group-time ATT}

Group-time ATT is the ATT for a specific group and time
\begin{itemize}
\item Groups are basically cohorts of units treated at the same time
\item Group-time ATT estimates are simple (weighted) differences in means
\item Does not directly restrict heterogeneity with respect to observed covariates, timing or the evolution of treatment effects over time
\item Allows us ways to choose our aggregations
\item Inference is the bootstrap
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Notation}

\begin{itemize}
\item $T$ periods going from $t=1, \dots, T$
\item Units are either treated ($D_t=1$) or untreated ($D_t=0$) but once treated cannot revert to untreated state
\item $G_g$ signifies a group and is binary.  Equals one if individual units are treated at time period $t$.
\item $C$ is also binary and indicates a control group unit equalling one if ``never treated'' (can be relaxed though to ``not yet treated'')
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Recall the problem with TWFE on using treatment units as controls
	\end{itemize}
\item Generalized propensity score enters into the estimator as a weight: $$\widehat{p(X)} = Pr(G_g=1 | X,G_c+C=1)$$
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Assumptions}

Assumption 1: Sampling is iid (panel data) \\
\bigskip
Assumption 2: Conditional parallel trends (for either never treated or not yet treated) \\
\begin{eqnarray*}
E[Y_t^0 - Y_{t-1}^0 | X,G_g=1] = [Y_t^0 - Y_{t-1}^0 | X,C=1] 
\end{eqnarray*}
\bigskip
Assumption 3: Irreversible treatment \\
Assumption 4: Common support (propensity score) \\
\bigskip
Assumption 5: Limited treatment anticipation (i.e., treatment effects are zero pre-treatment)

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{CS Estimator (the IPW version)}

\begin{eqnarray*}
ATT(g,t) = E \bigg [ \bigg ( \frac{G_g}{E[G_g]} - \frac{ \frac{\hat{p}(X)C}{1-\hat{p}(X)}}{E \bigg [ \frac{\hat{p}(X)C}{1-\hat{p}(X)} \bigg ]} \bigg ) (Y_t - Y_{g-1} ) \bigg ) \bigg ]
\end{eqnarray*}

This is the inverse probability weighting estimator.  Alternatively, there is an outcome regression approach and a doubly robust. Sant'Anna recommends DR. Notice hw CS doesn't use already-treated as controls.
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Staggered adoption (i.e., universal coverage)}


\begin{proof}{\textbf{Remark 1:}}
In some applications, eventually all units are treated, implying that $C$ is never equal to one. In such cases one can consider the ``not yet treated'' ($D_t = 0$) as a control group instead of
the ``never treated?'' ($C = 1$).
\end{proof}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Aggregated vs single year/group ATT}

\item The method they propose is really just identifying very narrow ATT per group time.

TWFE is no longer negative, interestingly, once we eliminate the last group (giving us a never-treated group), but is still suffering from attenuation bias.

\begin{frame}{Sun and Abraham 2020}

\begin{itemize}
\item Now that we know about the biases of the constant treatment effect model estimated with TWFE, let's revisit event studies under differential timing
\item Goodman-Bacon (2021, forthcoming) focused on decomposition of TWFE to show bias under differential timing
\item Callaway and Sant'anna (2020) presents alternative estimator that yields unbiased estimates of group-time ATTs which can be aggregated or put into event study plots
\item Sun and Abraham (SA) is like a combination of the two papers
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Summarizing (cont.)}

	\begin{enumerate}
	\item SA is a decomposition of the population regression coefficient on event study leads and lags with differential timing estimated with TWFE
	\item They show that the population regression coefficient is ``contaminated'' by information from other leads and lags
	\item SA presents an alternative estimator that is a version of CS only using the ``last cohort'' as the treatment group (not the not-yet-treated)
	\end{enumerate}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Summarizing (cont.)}

\begin{itemize}
\item Under homogenous treatment profiles, weights sum to zero and``cancel out'' the treatment effects from other periods 
\item Under treatment effect heterogeneity, they do not cancel out and leads and lags are biased
\item They present a 3-step TWFE based alternative estimator which addresses the problems that they find
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Some notation and terms}

\begin{itemize}
\item As people often \textbf{bin} the data, we allow a lead or lag $l$ to appear in bin $g$ so sometimes they use $g$ instead of $l$ or $l \in g$
\item Building block is the ``cohort-specific ATT'' or $CATT_{e,l}$ -- same as ATT(g,t)
\item Our goal is to estimate $CATT_{e,l}$ with population regression coefficient $\mu_l$
\item They focus on irreversible treatment where treatment status is non-decreasing sequence of zeroes and ones
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Difficult notation (cont.)}

\begin{itemize}
\item The $\infty$ symbol is used to either describe the group ($E_i=\infty$) or the potential outcome ($Y^{\infty}$)
\item $Y^{\infty}_{i,t}$ is is the potential outcome for unit $i$ if it had never received treatment (versus received it later), also called the baseline outcome
\item Other counterfactuals are possible -- maybe unit $i$ isn't ``never treated'' but treated later in counterfactual
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{More difficult notation (cont.)}

\begin{itemize}
\item Treatment effects are the difference between the observed outcome relative to the never-treated counterfactual outcome: $Y_{i,t} - Y^{\infty}_{i,t}$
\item We can take the average of treatment effects at a given relative time period across units first treated at time $E_i=e$ (same cohort) which is what we mean by $CATT_{e,l}$
\item Doesn't use $t$ index time (``calendar time''), rather uses $l$ which is time until or time after treatment date $e$ (``relative time'')
\item Think of it as ${l}=$year - treatment date
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Relative vs calendar event time}


\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[scale=0.2]{./lecture_includes/timetil}
\end{figure}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Definition 1}

\textbf{Definition 1:} The cohort-specific ATT $l$ periods from initial treatment date $e$ is:

\begin{eqnarray*}
CATT_{e,l} = E[Y_{i,e+l} - Y^{\infty}_{i,e+l} | E_i=e]
\end{eqnarray*}

\bigskip

Fill out the second part of the Group-time ATT exercise together.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{TWFE assumptions}

\begin{itemize}
\item For consistent estimates of the coefficient leads and lags using TWFE model, we need three assumptions
\item For SA and CS, we only need two
\item Let's look then at the three
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Assumption 1: Parallel trends}

\textbf{Assumption 1: Parallel trends in baseline outcomes}: $E[Y^{\infty}_{i,t} - Y^{\infty}_{i,s} | E_i = e ]$ is the same for all $e \in supp(E_i)$ and for all $s$, $t$ and is equal to $E[Y^{\infty}_{i,t} - Y^{\infty}_{i,s} ]$

\bigskip

Lead and lag coefficients are DiD equations but once we invoke parallel trends they can become causal parameters.  This reminds us again how crucial it is to have  appropriate controls

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Assumption 2: No anticipation}

\textbf{Assumption 2: No anticipator behavior in pre-treatment periods}: There is a set of pre-treatment periods such that $E[Y_{i,e+l}^e - Y_{i,e+l}^{\infty} | E_i = e]=0$ for all possible leads.

\bigskip

Essentially means that pre-treatment, the causal effect is zero.  Most plausible if no one sees the treatment coming, but even if they see it coming, they may not be able to make adjustments that affect outcomes

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Assumption 3: Homogeneity}

\textbf{Assumption 3: Treatment effect profile homogeneity}: For each relative time period $l$, the $CATT_{e,l}$ doesn't depend on the cohort and is equal to $CATT_l$. 


\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Treatment effect heterogeneity}

\begin{itemize}
\item Assumption 3 is violated when different cohorts experience different paths of treatment effects
\item Cohorts may differ in their covariates which affect how they respond to treatment (e.g., if treatment effects vary with age, and there is variation in age across units first treated at different times, then there will be heterogeneous treatment effects)
\item Doesn't rule out parallel trends
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Event study model}

\begin{eqnarray*}
Y_{i,t} = \alpha_i + \delta_t + \sum_{g \in G} \mu_g1\{t-E_i \in g \} + \varepsilon_{i,t}
\end{eqnarray*}

\bigskip

We are interested in the properties of $\mu_g$ under differential timing as well as whether there are any never-treated units

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Specifying the leads and lags}

How will we specify the $1\{t-E_i \in g \} $ term?  SA considers a couple:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Static specification: $$Y_{i,t} = \alpha_i + \delta_t + \mu_g \sum_{l \geq 0}D^l_{i,t} + \varepsilon_{i,t}$$
\item Dynamic specification: $$Y_{i,t} = \alpha_i + \delta_t + \sum_{l = -K}^{-2} \mu_l D^l_{i,t} + \sum_{l=0}^L\mu_lD^l_{i,t}+ \varepsilon_{i,t}$$
\end{enumerate}

\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Dropping, trimming and binning}

\begin{itemize}
\item Dynamic specification with differential timing requires dropping two leads: 
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item Drop the baseline to avoid multicollinearity in the relative time indicators 
	\item Drop a second one because of the multicollinearity coming from the linear relationship between TWFE and the relative period indicators.
	\end{enumerate}
\item Binning means placing all ``distant'' relative time indicators into a single one due to imbalance in relative event time
\item Trimming is done for the same reason but drops any relative time period for which you do not have balance
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[plain, shrink=20]
\begin{center}
\textbf{Interpreting $\widehat{\mu_g}$ under no to all assumptions}
\end{center}

\textbf{Proposition 1 (no assumptions):} The population regression coefficient on relative period bin $g$ is a linear combination of differences in trends from its own relative period $l \in g$, from relative periods $l \in g'$ of other bins $g' \neq g$, and from relative periods excluded from the specification (e.g., trimming). 

\begin{eqnarray*}
\mu_g &=& \underbrace{\sum_{l \in g} \sum_{e} w^g_{e,l} \big ( E[Y_{i,e+l} - Y^{\infty}_{i,0} | E_i = e] - E[Y^{\infty}_{i,e+l} - Y^{\infty}_{i,0}] \big )}_{\mathclap{\text{Targets}}} \\

&+&  \underbrace{\sum_{l \in g^{excl}} \sum_{e} w^g_{e,l} \big ( E[Y_{i,e+l} - Y^{\infty}_{i,0} | E_i=e] - E[Y^{\infty}_{i,e+l} - Y^{\infty}_{i,0}] \big )}_{\mathclap{\text{Contamination from dropped periods}}} 
\end{eqnarray*}

\bigskip


\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Weight ($w^g_{e,l}$) summation cheat sheet}

\begin{enumerate}
\item For relative periods of $\mu_g$ own $l \in g$, $\sum_{l \in g}\sum_ew^g_{e,l}=1$
\item For relative periods belonging to some other bin $l\in g'$ and $g' \neq g$, t $\sum_{l \in g'}\sum_ew^g_{e,l} = 0$
\item For relative periods not included in $G$, $\sum_{l \in g^{excl}} \sum_e w^g_{e,l} = -1$
\end{enumerate}

\end{frame}




\begin{frame}{Estimating the weights}

\item $\{ 1\{ t-E_i \in g \} \}_{g \in G}$(i.e., leads and lags) and 
\item the unit and time fixed effects
\end{enumerate}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Still biased under parallel trends}

\textbf{Proposition 2}: Under the parallel trends only, the population regression coefficient on the indicator for relative period bing $g$ is a linear combination of $CATT_{e,l \in g}$ as well as $CATT_{d,l'}$ from other relative periods $l' \notin g$ with the same weights stated in Proposition 1:

\begin{eqnarray*}
\mu_g &=& \underbrace{\sum_{l \in g} \sum_e w^g_{e,l} CATT_{e,l}}_{\mathclap{\text{Desirable}}} \\
&& + \underbrace{\sum_{g' \neq g, g' \in G} \sum_{l' \in g'} \sum_e w^g_{e,l'}  CATT_{e,l'}}_{\mathclap{\text{Bias from other specified bins}}} \\
&&+ \underbrace{\sum_{l' \in g^{excl}} \sum_e w^g_{e,l'} CATT_{e,l'}}_{\mathclap{\text{Bias from dropped relative time indicators}}}
\end{eqnarray*}



\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Still biased under parallel trends and no anticipation}

\textbf{Proposition 3}: If parallel trends holds and no anticipation holds for all $l<0$ (i.e., no anticipatory behavior pre-treatment), then the population regression coefficient $\mu_g$ for $g$ is a linear combination of post-treatment $CATT_{e,l'}$ for all $l' \geq 0$.

\begin{eqnarray*}
\mu_g &=& \sum_{l' \in g, l' \geq 0} \sum_e w^g_{e,l'} CATT_{e,l'} \\
&&+ \sum_{g' \neq g,g' \in G} \sum_{l' \in g', l' \geq 0} \sum_e w^g_{e,l'} CATT_{e,l'} \\
&&+ \sum_{l' \in g^{excl},l' \geq 0} \sum_e w^g_{w,l'} CATT_{e,l'}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Proposition 3 comment}

Notice how once we impose zero pre-treatment treatment effects, those terms are gone (i.e., no $l \in g, l<0$).  But the second term remains unless we impose treatment effect homogeneity (homogeneity causes terms due to weights summing to zero to cancel out). Thus $\mu_g$ may be non-zero for pre-treatment periods \emph{even though parallel trends hold in the pre period.}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Proposition 4}

\textbf{Proposition 4}: If parallel trends and treatment effect homogeneity, then $CATT_{e,l}=ATT_l$ is constant across $e$ for a given $l$, and the population regression coefficient $\mu_g$ is equal to a linear combination of $ATT_{l \in g}$, as well as $ATT_{l' \notin g}$ from other relative periods

\begin{eqnarray*}
\mu_g &=& \sum_{l \in g} w^g_l ATT_l \\
&&+ \sum_{g' \neq g} \sum_{l' \in g'} w^g_{l'} ATT_{l'} \\
&&+ \sum_{l' \in g^{excl}} w^g_{l'}ATT_{l'}
\end{eqnarray*}


\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Simple example}


Balanced panel $T=2$ with cohorts $E_i \in \{1,2 \}$. For illustrative purposes, we will include bins $\{-2,0\}$ in our calculations but drop $\{-1,1\}$. 


\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Simple example}

\begin{eqnarray*}
\mu_{-2} &=& \underbrace{CATT_{2,-2}}_{\mathclap{\text{own period}}} + \underbrace{\frac{1}{2}CATT_{1,0} - \frac{1}{2} CATT_{2,0}}_{\mathclap{\text{other included bins}}} \\
&&+ \underbrace{ \frac{1}{2} CATT_{1,1} - CATT_{1,-1} - \frac{1}{2} CATT_{2,-1} }_{\mathclap{\text{Excluded bins}}}
\end{eqnarray*}

\begin{itemize}
\item Parallel trends gets us to all of the $CATT$
\item No anticipation makes $CATT=0$ for all $l<0$ (all $l<0$ cancel out)
\item Homogeneity cancels second and third terms
\item Still leaves $\frac{1}{2} CATT_{1,1}$ -- you chose  to exclude a group with a treatment effect
\end{itemize}Lesson: drop the relative time indicators on the left, not things on the right, bc lagged effects will contaminate through the excluded bins


\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Robust event study estimation}


\begin{itemize}
\item All the robust estimators under differential timing have solutions and they all skip over forbidden contrasts. 
\item Sun and Abraham (2020) propose a 3-step interacted weighted estimator (IW) using last treated group as control group
\item Callaway and Sant'anna (2020) estimate group-time ATT which can be a weighted average over relative time periods too but uses ``not-yet-treated'' as control
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}




\begin{frame}{Interaction-weighted estimator}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Step one}: Do this DD regression and hold on to $\widehat{\delta}_{e,l}$
\end{itemize}

\begin{eqnarray*}
Y_{i,t} = \alpha_i + \lambda_t + \sum_{e \notin C} \sum_{l \neq -1} \delta_{e,l} \big (1 \{ E_i = e \} \cdot D_{i,t}^l \big ) + \varepsilon_{i,t}
\end{eqnarray*}


\bigskip

Can use never-treated or last-treated cohort. Drop always treated. The $\delta_{e,l}$ is a DD estimator for $CATT_{e,l}$ with particular choices for pre-period and cohort controls

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Interaction-weighted estimator}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Step two}: Estimate weights using sample shares of each cohort in the relevant periods:
\end{itemize}

\begin{eqnarray*}
Pr(E_i=e|E_i \in [-l,T-l])
\end{eqnarray*}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Interaction-weighted estimator}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Step three}: Take a weighted average of estimates for $CATT_{e,l}$ from Step 1 with weight estimates from step 2
\end{itemize}


\begin{eqnarray*}
\widehat{v}_g = \frac{1}{|g|} \sum_{l \in g} \sum_e \widehat{\delta}_{e,l} \widehat{Pr} \{ E_i=e | E_i \in [-l,T-l]\}
\end{eqnarray*}


\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Consistency and Inference}


\begin{itemize}
\item Under parallel trends and no anticipation, $\widehat{\delta}_{e,l}$ is consistent, and sample shares are also consistent estimators for population shares. 
\item Thus IV estimator is consistent for a weighted average of $CATT_{e,l}$ with weights equal to the share of each cohort in the relevant period(s).
\item They show that each IW estimator is asymptotically normal and derive its asymptotic variance. Doesn't rely on bootstrap like CS.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{DD Estimator of CATT}

\textbf{Definition 2}: DD estimator with pre-period $s$ and control cohorts $C$ estimates $CATT_{e,l}$ as:

\begin{eqnarray*}
\widehat{\delta_{e,l}} = \frac{ E_N \big [ \big ( Y_{i, e+l} - Y_{i,s} \big ) \times 1\{E_i=e\} \big ]}{E_N[1 \{E_i=e\} ]} - \frac{E_N \big [ \big ( Y_{i,e+l} \times 1 \{E_i \in C \} ]}{E_N [1 \{ E_i \in C \}]}
\end{eqnarray*}


\textbf{Proposition 5}: If parallel trends and no anticipation both hold for all pre-periods, then the DD estimator using any pre-period and non-empty control cohorts (never-treated or not-yet-treated) is an unbiased estimate for $CATT_{e,l}$

\subsection{dCH}

\begin{frame}{de Chaisemartin and D'Haultfoeulle 2020}

de Chaisemartin and D'Haultfouelle 2020 (dCdH) is different from the other papers in several ways
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Like SA, it's a diagnosis and a cure
	\item TWFE decomposition shows coefficient a weighted average of underlying treatment effects, but weights can be negative negating causal interpretation
	\item Propose a solution for both static and dynamic specification which does not use already treated as controls
	\item Treatment can turn on and off
	\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Comment on Bacon}

\begin{itemize}
\item Recall the Bacon decomposition -- TWFE coefficients are decomposed into weighted average of all underlying 2x2s. Weights were non-negative and summed to one.
\item But this decomposition was more a numerical decomposition -- what exactly adds up to equal the TWFE coefficient using the data we observe?
\item Bacon's decomposition is not ``theoretical'' -- not in the way that other decompositions are. He is just explaining what OLS ``does'' when it calculates $\widehat{\delta}$
\item Just explains what comparisons OLS is using to calculate the TWFE coefficient -- just peels back the curtain.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Causal effects}

\begin{itemize}
\item dCdH impose causal assumptions and try a different decomposition strategy
\item Uses as its building block the unit-specific treatment effects
\item This is hopefully going to help us better understand where these negative weights are coming from
\item Note that their model is very general in that the treatment is reversible (meaning you can turn it on and off)
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Terms}

\begin{itemize}
\item Target parameter: $$\Delta^g_{i,t} = Y^1_{i,t} - Y^\infty_{i,t}$$ but where the treatment is in time period $g$. Notice --it's not the ATT (it's $i$ individual treatment effect)
\item TWFE terms. Define the error term as $\varepsilon_{i,t}$: $$D_{i,t} = \alpha_i + \alpha_t + \varepsilon_{i,t}$$
\item Weights: $$w_{i,t} = \frac{\varepsilon_{i,t}}{\frac{1}{N^T} \sum_{i,t:D_{i,t}=1} \varepsilon_{i,t}}$$Basically divide the error by the average of the error for all treated units. 
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Assumptions}

\begin{block}{Strong unconditional PT}
Assume that for every time period $t$ and every group $g,g'$, $$E[Y^\infty_t - Y^\infty_{t-1}|G=g] = E[Y^\infty_t - Y^\infty_{t-1}|G=g'] $$
\end{block}Assume parallel trends for every unit in every cohort in every time period.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{dCdH Theorem}

\begin{block}{Theorem -- dCdH decomposition}
Assuming SUTVA, no anticipation and the strong PT, then let $\beta$ be the TWFE estimand associated with $$Y_{i,t} = \alpha_i + \alpha_t + \beta D_{i,t} + \varepsilon_{i,t}$$Then it follows that $$\beta = E \bigg [ \sum_{i,t:D_{i,t}=1} \frac{1}{N^T} w_{i,t} \cdot \Delta_{i,t}^g \bigg ] $$ where $\sum_{i,t:D_{i,t}=1} \frac{w_{i,t}}{N^T} = 1$ but $w_{i,t}$ can be negative
\end{block}So once you run that specification, $\beta$ is going to recover a non-convex average over all unit level treatment effects (weights can be negative). dCdH was the first I think.

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Negative weights}

\begin{itemize}
\item Very common now to hear about negative weights, and furthermore, that negative weights wipe out any causal interpretation, but why?
\item What if every unit treatment effect was positive, but some of the weights were negative?
\item It's possible it could flip the sign, but it would definitely at least pull the estimate away from the true effect
\item This is dangerous -- and it's caused by the forbidden contrasts (treated to already treated)
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Negative weights}

\begin{itemize}
\item Doesn't always pose a problem, but no proofs for this intuition known yet
\item A large number of never-treated seems to make this less an issue
\item Shrinking the spacing between treatment dates also can drive it down
\item But does that mean that TWFE works, and what does it mean to work?
\item TWFE still even when all the weights are positive the weighted average may not aggregate to what we think it does
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Weighting}

\begin{itemize}
\item The weights in OLS all come out of the model itself, \emph{not the economic question}
\item The economic question is ``what parameter do you want? What does it look like? Who is in it?''
\item And when you define the parameter up front, you've more or less defined the economic question you're asking
\item But OLS sort of ignores your question and just gives you what it wants
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Weighting}

\begin{itemize}
\item What makes something a good vs a bad weight?
\item Not being negative is the absolute minimal requirement
\item But it's also not a good sign if you can't really explain the weights
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{dCdH Solution}

\begin{itemize}
\item dCdH propose an alternative that doesn't have the problems of TWFE -- both avoiding negative weights and improving interpretability
\item Recall, their model can handle reversible treatments

\end{itemize}
